                Bodhi的预测市场可以为经济事件带来更加细微和详细的表达方式，从而可以从宏观和微观经济层面更明确地评估价值及风险，并降低中介费用，去除专业化门槛，易于拓展，提高准确率且高效。例如，创建一个预测事件如“苹果的股票在2018年1月1日的开盘价是多少？”在Bodhi上被提这个预测事件，获得的结果是全网的计算结果，不仅成本低廉，而且结果更精准，效率更高，还能拓展到其他股票，任意时间，收盘价等等。

                                which allow users to make predictions and to obtain BOT for successful predictions, initiate
                                arbitration for disputed results of prediction events and receive additional tokens accordingly,
                                and vote for arbitration results of disputed prediction events and receive additional tokens
                                accordingly. Specifically, BOT provide the infrastructure for PM through Issuer&rsquo;s website

                                "oracles" (which conclusively determine the outcome of prediction events) in exceptional

                                    <p>Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with BOT

                                    <p>BOT are intended to be used solely within the network for the PM, hence there may be

                                        is facilitated by third party exchanges, such exchanges may be relatively new and
                                        subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to fraud
                                        or manipulation. Furthermore, to the extent that third parties do ascribe an external
                                        exchange value to BOT (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such
                                        value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.</p>
